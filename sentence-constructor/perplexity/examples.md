Note: Good, each state is shown by the LLM, Setup, Attempt eg. Output is poor though. If I question the output as wrong, it is ignored. Will rework prompt with a <query> input

## First Attempt after initial testing

### Input

Hello my name is John

State: Setup
Okay, the sentence we'll work with is: "Hello, my name is John."

Here's a vocabulary table to get you started:

| Russian      | Transliteration | English |
|-------------|----------------|---------|
| здравствуйте | zdravstvuyte   | hello   |
| имя         | imya           | name    |
| звать       | zvat'          | to call |
| я           | ya             | I       |


Here's a possible sentence structure to guide you:

Hello, I [verb: to call] name John.
Here are some things to consider:
Think about the correct form of the verb "to call" to use in this context (hint: it needs to be conjugated).
Consider the case of "name"
"Hello" has a formal and informal version. Which do you want to use?
What is the next step? Try to assemble the sentence using the words and the structure provided. Don't worry about being wrong, that is part of learning!

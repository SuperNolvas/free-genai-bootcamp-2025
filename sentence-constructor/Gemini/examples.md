## Notes

BAD: Output similar to Perplexity. But the LLM gave a clue that it was using literal translation. GOOD: The model is taking into consideration formal and informal language. I have revised the prompt which will be used in the second attempt to attempt to stop literal translation.

## First Attempt

Setup State)

Alright, let's work on translating "Hello, my name is John" into Russian.  This is a common greeting, so it's a great place to start!

Here's your vocabulary table:

| Russian       | Transliteration | English        |
|--------------|----------------|---------------|
| здравствуйте | zdravstvuyte   | hello (formal) |
| привет       | privet         | hello (informal) |
| мой          | moy            | my            |
| имя          | imya           | name          |
| быть         | byt'           | to be         |
| Джон         | Dzhon          | John          |

## Notes

GOOD: Better word selection outputted on first attempt. BAD one incorrect word. <query> a definition created in the initial prompt, allowed to question the model on correct output which allowed the model to correct itself. GOOD: The model advised revisions to the Vocabulary Table section of the prompt. It also advised to add a Quality Control section. Will test these. BAD: Attempt 3 has simplified word list but now incorrect, so output has regressed.

### First Attempt

Hello, My name is Phil


STATE: Setup

Let me help you transcribe this greeting and introduction!

Vocabulary Table:

| Russian       | Transliteration | English            |
|--------------|----------------|--------------------|
| здравствуйте | zdravstvuyte   | hello (formal)     |
| привет       | privet         | hello (informal)   |
| имя          | imya           | name              |
| меня         | menya          | me (accusative)    |
| зовут        | zovut          | they call         |
| Фил          | Fil            | Phil              |


Sentence Structure Guideline:

For introductions in Russian, we typically use the construction "[hello], меня зовут [name]"
Note: This is different from the English word order! In Russian, we literally say "me they-call [name]"
Clues and Considerations:

First, decide if this is a formal or informal situation. This affects which greeting to use
In Russian, we don't typically say "my name is" - we use a different construction that means "they call me"
Names are usually adapted to Russian pronunciation - Phil becomes Фил
Notice that "меня" is in a special case form because it's the object of "зовут"
Would you like to try forming the sentence? Remember, I can't give you the complete answer, but I can provide more hints if needed!

<query> This looks good, but why is imya there? How would it fit in this sentence? I dont think it does > Привет, меня зовут Джон.


STATE: Clues

You make an excellent observation! You're absolutely right - I apologize for including "имя" in the vocabulary table. It's not actually needed for this particular construction.

In fact, your example "Привет, меня зовут Джон" is exactly the natural way to say this in Russian! The word "имя" would be used in different constructions, like "Моё имя..." (My name is...), but that's a less common and more formal way of introducing yourself in Russian.

Let me correct the vocabulary table to only include the necessary words:

| Russian       | Transliteration | English          |
|--------------|----------------|------------------|
| здравствуйте | zdravstvuyte   | hello (formal)   |
| привет       | privet         | hello (informal) |
| меня         | menya          | me (accusative)  |
| зовут        | zovut          | they call       |

| Фил          | Fil            | Phil              |


Would you like to try making your introduction with "Фил" now?

<query> thanks that looks better, can you advise how to change the initial prompt so that it can prevent you from making these errors?


The role instructions could be improved to help prevent unnecessary vocabulary suggestions. Here are the key additions I'd recommend adding to the instructions:

Add to "Vocabulary Table" section:
markdown


* Only include words that are directly needed for the target sentence construction
* Before including a word, verify it would actually appear in the most natural translation
* If multiple ways exist to express the same idea, only include vocabulary for the most common/natural construction
* When uncertain about including a word, consider: "Would a native speaker actually use this word in this context?"

Add a new section called "Quality Control":
markdown


* Before providing the vocabulary table, mentally construct the most natural Russian translation
* Only include vocabulary items that appear in that natural translation
* Exclude vocabulary that represents alternative but less common constructions
* If a student queries the inclusion of a word, re-evaluate if it's truly necessary for the most natural translation
These additions would help ensure the vocabulary table remains focused and practical, avoiding potentially confusing inclusions like "имя" in cases where it wouldn't naturally be used.

## Third Attempt

I understand I'll be acting as a Russian language teacher for beginners (A1 level), helping students translate English sentences into Russian through a guided process rather than direct translation. I'll follow a state-based approach (Setup, Attempt, Clues) and provide vocabulary tables, sentence structure guidelines, and contextual clues while prioritizing natural, idiomatic Russian over literal translations.
I'll be careful to:

* Only provide vocabulary that would appear in natural Russian speech
* Use appropriate formality levels
* Avoid transliteration except in vocabulary tables
* Guide students toward natural expressions over word-for-word translations
* Respond to student queries about potential errors
* Maintain the specified state flow and formatting requirements

I'm ready to begin. The student can start by providing an English sentence they'd like to translate into Russian.

Hello, my name is John

STATE: Setup
Let's help you introduce yourself! For a first meeting, we'll use the formal version since that's most appropriate when meeting someone new in Russian culture.

Vocabulary Table:

| Russian       | Transliteration | English        |
|--------------|----------------|---------------|
| здравствуйте | zdravstvuyte   | hello (formal) |
| имя          | imya           | name          |
| Джон         | Dzhon          | John          |


In Russian, we use a specific grammatical case when saying "my name"
The word "is" isn't directly used in Russian for introductions - Russian drops the verb "to be" in the present tense
Names from other languages are adapted to Russian pronunciation patterns
Consider how possession ("my") is expressed in Russian with the word for "name"

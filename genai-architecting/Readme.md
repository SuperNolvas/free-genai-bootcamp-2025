## Functional Requirements

The business wants to invest in their own infrastructure, because of privacy concerns of user data and that the cost for managed cloud based services for GenAI will greatly raise in cost

They would like to invest in an AI PC where they can afford to spend for the specific hardware to run the GenAI locally, they can afford to spend $10K - $15K on this PC. They have nearly 300 active students, and the students are located in Tokyo.

## Assumptions

There is the assumption that the Open sourced LLMs will be powerful enough to run on hardware with the disclosed aforementioned approximate investment

The GenAI server must have enough bandwidth to serve the 300 students

## Data Strategy

There is a concern regarding copyrighted materials, so we need to purchase and supply materials  and store them in our database

## Considerations

We are considering using IBM Granite because it is a truly open-source model with training data that is traceable so we can avoid copyright issues

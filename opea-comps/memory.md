# Summary of GenAIComps and GenAIExamples Repositories

## Summary of GenAIComps

GenAIComps (Generative AI Components) is a framework designed to build enterprise-grade Generative AI applications using a microservice architecture. It provides:

1. **Microservices**: Individual, containerized components that perform specific AI functions:
   - LLM services (using models like Intel/neural-chat-7b-v3-3)
   - Embedding services (using models like BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5)
   - Retriever services
   - Reranking services
   - Text-to-image, image-to-image, image-to-video services
   - ASR (Audio Speech Recognition) and TTS (Text-to-Speech) services
   - Agent services (including SQL agents, RAG agents, ReAct agents)
   - And many others

2. **Megaservices**: Higher-level constructs that orchestrate multiple microservices to create end-to-end applications. The ServiceOrchestrator class allows connecting multiple microservices into complex workflows.

3. **Hardware Optimization**: Services designed to run efficiently on different hardware:
   - Intel Xeon CPUs
   - Intel Gaudi2 AI accelerators

4. **Deployment Options**: All services are containerized for cloud-native deployment using Docker or Kubernetes.

The project uses various AI frameworks (LangChain, LlamaIndex) and serving technologies (TGI, vLLM, TEI-Gaudi) to optimize performance.

## Summary of GenAIExamples

GenAIExamples showcases practical applications built using the GenAIComps framework. It includes:

1. **Ready-to-use AI Applications**:
   - AgentQnA: Question answering using agent capabilities
   - AudioQnA: Question answering from audio input
   - AvatarChatbot: Interactive chatbot with avatar visualization
   - ChatQnA: Text-based chatbot with RAG capabilities
   - CodeGen: Code generation
   - DBQnA: Database question answering
   - DocSum: Document summarization
   - EdgeCraftRAG: Retrieval-augmented generation
   - GraphRAG: Graph-based RAG
   - VideoQnA: Question answering from video content
   - And many others

2. **Deployment & Benchmarking**: The repository includes tools for deploying and benchmarking these applications:
   - deploy.py and deploy_and_benchmark.py for deployment
   - benchmark.py for performance evaluation

3. **Docker & Kubernetes Support**: Docker compose files and Kubernetes configurations for containerized deployment

## Relationship Between the Two

GenAIComps provides the building blocks (microservices) and orchestration capabilities, while GenAIExamples demonstrates how to combine these components into practical AI applications. Together, they form a comprehensive framework for building, deploying, and benchmarking enterprise-grade generative AI applications, with a focus on utilizing Intel hardware (both CPUs and AI accelerators) efficiently.

The framework emphasizes modularity, scalability, and flexibility, allowing developers to mix and match components to create custom AI solutions tailored to specific business needs.

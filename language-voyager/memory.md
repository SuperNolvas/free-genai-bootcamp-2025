# Project Memory: Language Voyager Development Log

## Technical Stack Confirmation
- Confirmed Python as primary development language due to:
  - FastAPI backend compatibility
  - Strong GIS processing libraries
  - Excellent vector database support (FAISS/Chroma)
  - Rich scientific computing ecosystem for NLP
  - Easy integration with OpenRouter API

## ArcGIS Implementation Considerations
- Available Resources:
  - 21-day free trial
  - 400 credits limitation
  
### Credit Usage Strategic Planning
- Need to carefully manage ArcGIS credit consumption
- Recommendation: Delay ArcGIS integration until core backend is stable
- Credits should be reserved for:
  - Final testing phase
  - Production implementation
  - Critical feature validation

## Proposed Staged Rollout Plan
1. Core Backend Setup (FastAPI + PostgreSQL)
2. Basic Map Integration (ArcGIS) - *Delayed until stable core*
3. Initial Language Content Management System
4. Basic LLM Integration
5. Simple Frontend UI
6. Vector Database Integration
7. User Authentication
8. Advanced Features (multiplayer, achievements)

## Technical Decisions Made
1. Python confirmed as primary backend language
2. ArcGIS integration to be carefully timed due to credit limitations
3. Need to develop test cases with mock GIS data before actual ArcGIS integration

## Next Steps
- Begin with core backend implementation
- Prepare mock GIS data for development
- Design credit-efficient ArcGIS implementation strategy
- Develop offline testing capabilities for map features

## Testing Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Backend Testing
1. **Unit Testing**
   - FastAPI endpoint testing with pytest
   - Database model validation
   - Authentication flow verification
   - Mock spatial data handling

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Database interactions
   - Cache management (Redis)
   - Session handling
   - Basic API workflows

### Phase 2: Mock GIS Testing
1. **Offline Testing Environment**
   - Mock ArcGIS responses using recorded data
   - Simulated POI data
   - Test coordinate systems
   - Cache validation

2. **Performance Baseline**
   - Response time benchmarking
   - Memory usage monitoring
   - Database query optimization
   - Mock load testing

### Phase 3: Language Content System Testing
1. **Content Management**
   - Vector database CRUD operations
   - Content retrieval performance
   - Embedding generation accuracy
   - Content versioning

2. **LLM Integration**
   - Prompt template validation
   - Response quality assessment
   - Error handling and fallbacks
   - Context window optimization

### Phase 4: ArcGIS Live Testing (Credit-Conscious)
1. **Pre-Live Preparation**
   - Comprehensive test cases documented
   - Monitoring setup ready
   - Rollback procedures in place
   - Credit usage tracking implemented

2. **Controlled Testing**
   - Single region testing (e.g., Tokyo central)
   - Limited feature set
   - Credit usage monitoring
   - Performance metrics collection

3. **Credit Conservation Strategies**
   - Implement aggressive caching
   - Use tile package downloads
   - Optimize query patterns
   - Limit unnecessary API calls

### Phase 5: Integration Testing
1. **Component Integration**
   - Frontend-Backend communication
   - GIS-LLM interaction
   - User progress tracking
   - Real-time features

2. **End-to-End Testing**
   - Complete user journeys
   - Error scenarios
   - Edge cases
   - Performance under load

### Phase 6: User Acceptance Testing
1. **Internal Testing**
   - Team playtesting
   - Feature completeness verification
   - UX flow validation
   - Performance assessment

2. **Beta Testing**
   - Limited user group
   - Feedback collection
   - Metrics gathering
   - Stability monitoring

### Testing Tools and Infrastructure
- pytest for Python unit testing
- Locust for load testing
- Prometheus for metrics
- Sentry for error tracking
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Docker for consistent environments

### Quality Metrics
- Test coverage > 80%
- API response time < 200ms
- Map rendering time < 1s
- LLM response time < 2s
- Error rate < 0.1%

*Note: This testing strategy will be updated based on implementation experience and specific challenges encountered.*

### Credit Usage Monitoring
- Daily credit usage reporting
- Automatic alerts at 25%, 50%, 75% usage
- Emergency shutdown at 90% usage
- Credit usage optimization review every 3 days

*Note: This testing strategy will be updated based on implementation experience and specific challenges encountered.*

 a comprehensive testing strategy that is particularly mindful of ArcGIS credit usage. The key points of the strategy ensure that:

1. Most testing is done with mocked GIS data before touching ArcGIS credits
2. We have a clear credit budget allocation (100/200/100 split)
3. Live testing is concentrated in a small geographic area (Tokyo station)
4. Strict monitoring and optimization practices are in place

# Project Memory: Language Voyager Development Log

## Technical Stack Confirmation
- Confirmed Python as primary development language due to:
  - FastAPI backend compatibility
  - Strong GIS processing libraries
  - Excellent vector database support (FAISS/Chroma)
  - Rich scientific computing ecosystem for NLP
  - Easy integration with OpenRouter API

## ArcGIS Implementation Considerations
- Available Resources:
  - 21-day free trial
  - 400 credits limitation
  
### Credit Usage Strategic Planning
- Need to carefully manage ArcGIS credit consumption
- Recommendation: Delay ArcGIS integration until core backend is stable
- Credits should be reserved for:
  - Final testing phase
  - Production implementation
  - Critical feature validation

## Proposed Staged Rollout Plan
1. Core Backend Setup (FastAPI + PostgreSQL)
2. Basic Map Integration (ArcGIS) - *Delayed until stable core*
3. Initial Language Content Management System
4. Basic LLM Integration
5. Simple Frontend UI
6. Vector Database Integration
7. User Authentication
8. Advanced Features (multiplayer, achievements)

## Technical Decisions Made
1. Python confirmed as primary backend language
2. ArcGIS integration to be carefully timed due to credit limitations
3. Need to develop test cases with mock GIS data before actual ArcGIS integration

## Next Steps
- Begin with core backend implementation
- Prepare mock GIS data for development
- Design credit-efficient ArcGIS implementation strategy
- Develop offline testing capabilities for map features

*Note: This is a living document that will be updated as the project progresses.*

  - Three-panel view (navigation, endpoints, models)
  - More readable format
- Primary Use Cases:
  - Production documentation
  - External developer reference

- Schema built from:
  - Route decorators (@app.get(), @app.post(), etc.)
  - Pydantic models
  - Function docstrings
  - Parameter descriptions
  - Security schemes

*Note: Both documentation interfaces verified working and accessible after initial backend setup.*

  ```
Verification Status:
- User creation successful

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/auth/me \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ0ZXN0QGV4YW1wbGUuY29tIiwiZXhwIjoxNzQxODEyNDY1fQ.s7-MCh2RzkcBAD45ojAuhhZK56YS2zzoTORa-seEjPU"

Response:
{
  "id": 1,
  "email": "test@example.com",
  "username": "testuser",
  "is_active": true
}
```

Verification Status:

- Response format matches UserResponse model
- Authorization header properly processed

*Note: Complete authentication flow now verified:
1. User registration
2. Login with credentials
3. JWT token generation
4. Protected endpoint access with token*

## Authentication Implementation Progress
### Email Validation Dependency Issue
- Initial attempt to implement user registration failed
- Error: "ImportError: email-validator is not installed, run `pip install pydantic[email]`"
- Root cause: Pydantic's EmailStr validator requires email-validator package

### Resolution Steps
1. Package Installation
   - Added email-validator==2.1.0 to requirements.txt
   - Initial Docker rebuild failed due to layer caching:
     ```
     => CACHED [web 3/5] COPY requirements.txt .
     => CACHED [web 4/5] RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
     ```
   - Required no-cache rebuild to force package installation

2. Docker Rebuild Process
   - Used `docker compose build --no-cache web` to force fresh build
   - Success confirmed with new package installation:
     ```

     => [web 4/5] RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
     ```
   - Services restarted and health checks passed:
     - Database container healthy
     - Redis container running
     - Web container started

*Note: This illustrates the importance of understanding Docker layer caching when adding new dependencies, and the need for --no-cache flag when updating requirements.*

## Docker Network Configuration
### Network Overview
Current Docker networks:
```
NETWORK ID     NAME                       DRIVER    SCOPE
2ce6ad2c96a2   bridge                     bridge    local
569045d45cad   host                       host      local
506346b9054b   language-voyager_default   bridge    local
e21c62b5d502   none                       null      local
```

### Network Types and Usage
1. **bridge** (default bridge network):
   - Docker's default network driver
   - Used for standalone containers
   - Provides internal network isolation

2. **host**:
   - Removes network isolation
   - Container uses host's network directly
   - Higher performance but less secure

3. **language-voyager_default**:
   - Our project's custom bridge network
   - Created automatically by Docker Compose
   - Enables container-to-container communication
   - Used by our PostgreSQL, Redis, and FastAPI services

4. **none**:
   - Complete network isolation
   - No external network access
   - Used for maximum security requirements

### Request Routing Behavior
Observed in API logs:
```
INFO:     172.18.0.1:51706 - "POST /auth/register HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
INFO:     172.18.0.1:47976 - "POST /auth/token HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
INFO:     172.18.0.1:34274 - "GET /auth/me HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
```

Request Flow:
1. Host machine makes request to localhost:8000
2. Docker routes through gateway (172.18.0.1)
3. Request reaches FastAPI container
4. Different ports (51706, 47976, 34274) are ephemeral ports from host machine
5. Each new connection gets unique port number

*Note: This network configuration ensures proper isolation while maintaining necessary communication between services.*

## Environment Configuration Cleanup
### Configuration File Consolidation
- Removed duplicate .env from app/ directory
- Consolidated all environment variables to root .env
- Maintained comprehensive .env.example template with documentation
- Verified docker-compose.yml using root .env file correctly

### Environment Structure
1. Development Configuration (.env):
   - All necessary variables for development
   - Debug mode enabled
   - Development-specific URLs and endpoints

2. Example Template (.env.example):
   - Comprehensive documentation
   - Production-ready defaults
   - Clear comments for each variable
   - Local and Docker configuration options

3. Docker Integration:
   - Using env_file directive in docker-compose.yml
   - Container-specific URLs (db, redis hostnames)
   - Health check configuration preserved

*Note: Environment configuration consolidated and documented. All services verified working with unified configuration.*

## Progress Update - Stage 2 Implementation
### Database Migration System (Alembic)
#### Current Implementation Status
1. **Migration History**
   - Successfully implemented two key migrations:
     - 20250313_171128_e4c9af91068b_enhance_arcgis_usage_tracking
     - 20250313_171517_aae1b821a939_enhance_arcgis_usage_tracking
   - Enhanced ArcGIS usage tracking with cached response and request path monitoring

### ArcGIS Free Tier Implementation
#### Usage Limits Implementation
Current implementation carefully manages the following monthly limits:
1. **Basemap Tiles**: 2M tiles/month
2. **Place Searches**: 500 searches/month
3. **Place Attributes**: 100 attributes/month
4. **Geocoding Operations**: 20K operations/month
5. **Basic Routes**: 20K routes/month
6. **Elevation Points**: 50K points/month

#### Usage Management System
1. **Monthly Quota Tracking**
   - Real-time usage monitoring
   - Per-operation type tracking
   - Monthly reset automation
   - Usage alerts at defined thresholds

2. **Caching Strategy**

   - Emergency notification at 95% usage
   - Daily usage reports

*Note: Stage 2 implementation focuses on efficient ArcGIS service usage while staying within free tier limits.*


## Database Schema Migration Progress
### ArcGIS Usage Tracking Migrations
1. **Initial Migration (e4c9af91068b)**
   - Base table creation completed
   - Core columns implemented:
     - id (integer, primary key with sequence)
     - operation_type (character varying)
     - credits_used (double precision)
     - timestamp (timestamptz, defaulting to now())
   - Added primary key and id index

2. **Enhancement Migration (aae1b821a939)**
   - Added caching support columns:
     - cached (boolean, not null, default false)
     - request_path (character varying)
   - Implemented compound index (ix_usage_timestamp_op) on timestamp and operation_type for efficient monthly queries

### Migration Verification
- Successfully applied both migrations
- Database schema matches model specification
- All columns have correct data types and constraints
- Indexes properly created for query optimization
- Transactional DDL ensured atomic migration application

*Note: Database schema now fully supports ArcGIS usage tracking with caching optimization and efficient querying capabilities.*

# Project Memory: Language Voyager Development Log

## Technical Stack Confirmation
- Confirmed Python as primary development language due to:
  - FastAPI backend compatibility
  - Strong GIS processing libraries
  - Excellent vector database support (FAISS/Chroma)
  - Rich scientific computing ecosystem for NLP
  - Easy integration with OpenRouter API

## ArcGIS Implementation Considerations
- Available Resources:
  - 21-day free trial
  - 400 credits limitation
  
### Credit Usage Strategic Planning
- Need to carefully manage ArcGIS credit consumption
- Recommendation: Delay ArcGIS integration until core backend is stable
- Credits should be reserved for:
  - Final testing phase
  - Production implementation
  - Critical feature validation

## Proposed Staged Rollout Plan
1. Core Backend Setup (FastAPI + PostgreSQL)
2. Basic Map Integration (ArcGIS) - *Delayed until stable core*
3. Initial Language Content Management System
4. Basic LLM Integration
5. Simple Frontend UI
6. Vector Database Integration
7. User Authentication
8. Advanced Features (multiplayer, achievements)

## Technical Decisions Made
1. Python confirmed as primary backend language
2. ArcGIS integration to be carefully timed due to credit limitations
3. Need to develop test cases with mock GIS data before actual ArcGIS integration

## Next Steps
- Begin with core backend implementation
- Prepare mock GIS data for development
- Design credit-efficient ArcGIS implementation strategy
- Develop offline testing capabilities for map features

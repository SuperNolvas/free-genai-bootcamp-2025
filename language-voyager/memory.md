# Project Memory: Language Voyager Development Log

## Technical Stack Confirmation
- Confirmed Python as primary development language due to:
  - FastAPI backend compatibility
  - Strong GIS processing libraries
  - Excellent vector database support (FAISS/Chroma)
  - Rich scientific computing ecosystem for NLP
  - Easy integration with OpenRouter API

## ArcGIS Implementation Considerations
- Available Resources:
  - 21-day free trial
  - 400 credits limitation
  
### Credit Usage Strategic Planning
- Need to carefully manage ArcGIS credit consumption
- Recommendation: Delay ArcGIS integration until core backend is stable
- Credits should be reserved for:
  - Final testing phase
  - Production implementation
  - Critical feature validation

## Proposed Staged Rollout Plan
1. Core Backend Setup (FastAPI + PostgreSQL)
2. Basic Map Integration (ArcGIS) - *Delayed until stable core*
3. Initial Language Content Management System
4. Basic LLM Integration
5. Simple Frontend UI
6. Vector Database Integration
7. User Authentication
8. Advanced Features (multiplayer, achievements)

## Technical Decisions Made
1. Python confirmed as primary backend language
2. ArcGIS integration to be carefully timed due to credit limitations
3. Need to develop test cases with mock GIS data before actual ArcGIS integration

## Next Steps
- Begin with core backend implementation
- Prepare mock GIS data for development
- Design credit-efficient ArcGIS implementation strategy
- Develop offline testing capabilities for map features

*Note: This is a living document that will be updated as the project progresses.*

   - GIS-LLM interaction
   - User progress tracking
   - Real-time features

2. **End-to-End Testing**
   - Complete user journeys
   - Error scenarios
   - Edge cases
   - Performance under load

### Phase 6: User Acceptance Testing
1. **Internal Testing**
   - Team playtesting
   - Feature completeness verification
   - UX flow validation
   - Performance assessment

2. **Beta Testing**
   - Limited user group
   - Feedback collection
   - Metrics gathering
   - Stability monitoring

### Testing Tools and Infrastructure
- pytest for Python unit testing
- Locust for load testing
- Prometheus for metrics
- Sentry for error tracking
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Docker for consistent environments

### Quality Metrics
- Test coverage > 80%
- API response time < 200ms

### Database Connection Verification
### Initial Attempt
- First database health check failed with SQLAlchemy text expression error
- Error: "Textual SQL expression 'SELECT 1' should be explicitly declared as text('SELECT 1')"

### Resolution
- Updated health check endpoint to use SQLAlchemy's text() function
- Modified database check query implementation in main.py
- Successful health check response achieved:
  ```json
  {"status":"online","database":"healthy"}
  ```

### Docker Configuration Improvements
- Added PostgreSQL and Redis healthchecks
- Implemented proper service dependencies with health conditions
- Web service now waits for database readiness
- Successful container orchestration with proper startup order

### Current State
- FastAPI application running with hot-reload enabled
- Database connection verified and working
- Docker containers running with proper health checks
- Basic API structure in place with root and health endpoints
- Environment variables properly configured

*Note: Database connection and container health verification completed successfully. Ready to proceed with authentication system implementation.*

*Note: This assessment was conducted after initial Stage 1 rollout began. The pending items are listed in priority order for implementation.*

  - Pydantic models
  - Function docstrings
  - Parameter descriptions

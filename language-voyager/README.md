# Language Voyager: Geo-Immersive Language Learning

![Project Demo](screenshots/Demo.gif)

**Concept:** A game where players "travel" through a country or region using ArcGIS maps to learn the local language through location-specific vocabulary, cultural contexts, and interactive conversations.

## Current Implementation Status

The project currently has:
- ✅ Full-featured backend with FastAPI
- ✅ Basic frontend with login functionality
- ✅ Tokyo region mapping with bounded exploration
- ✅ Random user placement within Tokyo
- ✅ Random Location button functionality
- ✅ Location-aware chat system with LLM integration
- ✅ Real-time location updates

Features marked with ⏳ in this document are planned for future implementation.

## Core Gameplay

Players navigate a detailed ArcGIS map of their target language's country (e.g., Japan for Japanese learners). As they explore, they encounter:

1. **Location-based vocabulary challenges** - Learn words relevant to specific locations
2. **Conversation simulations** with virtual locals using the LLM
3. **Cultural missions** that combine language learning with cultural knowledge
4. **Progressive difficulty** as players "unlock" new regions

## Container Structure

The application uses Docker health checks to ensure services are properly initialized:
- Database: PostgreSQL database service with health checks
- Cache: Redis cache service with health checks  
- Web API: FastAPI service that waits for dependent services

You can monitor container health & status using:
```bash
docker compose ps
```

Example output:
```
NAME                       IMAGE                  COMMAND                  SERVICE   CREATED      STATUS                   PORTS

```

## Application Demo screens

1. Here is the initial login screen using the test credentials provided above

![Login Screen](screenshots/Login_Screen.png)

2. The random locations are bounded within the Tokyo region, so the blue rectangle shown on the zoomed out map example below 


![Region Boundary](screenshots/map_boundary.png)

3. Once you login you will see the Map screen and Chat container screen, you will be presented with a random location

![Initial Screen](screenshots/Initial_screen.png)

4. Now you can ask the LLM a question. The LLM is aware of the current location displayed at the top of the chat container, and it can reply to you with context aware responses based on the current location.

![Example first question](screenshots/1st_question.png)

5. Here is a follow up question

![Follow Up Question](screenshots/follow_up_question.png)

6. If you use Japanese in your reply, the LLM should reply back with more examples in Japanese. You can use Hirigana, Kanji, Katakana and Romanji to converse with the LLM and it can respond back with examples using these writing systems and again the responses are location aware. 


![Japanese question example](screenshots/location_aware_question.png)

7. To change random location click on the blue Random Location button at the bottom center of the map

![Changing random location](screenshots/moving_to_random_location.png)

8. Lastly there are water features on the map, ocean and rivers. You can for example be located over a body of water and you can ask the LLM a location aware question

## Map-Driven Game Logic

### 1. Geographic Context Engine

The game uses ArcGIS layers to create a semantic understanding of locations:

- **POI Classification System**: ArcGIS data classifies locations (restaurants, train stations, parks, etc.) which directly determines vocabulary sets presented to the user
- **Urban vs. Rural Detection**: The game automatically adjusts language difficulty and dialect based on population density data
- **Elevation and Terrain Analysis**: Triggers appropriate nature vocabulary in mountainous regions versus coastal areas

### 2. Cultural Zones and Language Variation

- **Regional Dialect Mapping**: ArcGIS boundaries define where dialectal variations appear in conversations
- **Historical Data Integration**: Older neighborhoods trigger traditional language forms and cultural references
- **Demographic Data Utilization**: Areas with different age distributions present language appropriate to those demographics (youth slang in university districts)

### 3. Distance-Based Progression

- **Travel Mechanics**: Players must "travel" realistic distances on the map, with language difficulty increasing with distance from starting point
- **Transportation Networks**: Using train lines, roads and other transportation features to gate progress until specific vocabulary is mastered
- **Border Crossings**: Natural features like rivers or mountains serve as skill checkpoints requiring specific grammar or vocabulary mastery

## Technical Implementation of Map-Based Logic

```python
# Pseudocode for map-based language content selection
def determine_language_content(user_position, user_proficiency):
    # Query ArcGIS for location details
    location_data = arcgis_service.query_location(
        latitude=user_position.lat,
        longitude=user_position.lng
    )

    # Extract contextual information
    location_type = location_data.get_primary_classification()  # e.g., "restaurant", "train_station"
    region = location_data.get_administrative_region()  # e.g., "Kansai", "Tohoku"
    urban_density = location_data.get_population_density()  # e.g., "urban", "rural"

    # Select appropriate language content
    vocabulary_set = vector_db.query(
        context=location_type,
        region=region,
        difficulty=user_proficiency
    )

    # Adjust conversation style based on location
    dialect_settings = dialect_rules.get(region, "standard")
    formality_level = determine_formality(location_type, urban_density)

    return {
        "vocabulary": vocabulary_set,
        "dialect": settings,
        "formality": formality_level,
        "cultural_notes": get_cultural_context(location_data)
    }

```

## Core Map Integration Features

### 1. Interactive Layer System

- **Base Topographic Layer**: Provides geographic context and realistic navigation
- **POI Layer**: Points of interest with attached language challenges
- **Progress Layer**: Visual indicators of completed challenges and mastered areas
- **Custom Game Layer**: Shows missions, collectibles, and other game elements

### 2. Spatial Relationship Logic

The game constantly evaluates the player's position relative to other map elements:

- **Proximity Triggers**: As players approach specific features (temples, markets), relevant language modules activate
- **View Analysis**: What the player can "see" from their position affects conversation topics
- **Path Planning**: The system suggests linguistic challenges based on optimal routes between locations

### 3. Geofencing Mechanics

- **Language Immersion Zones**: Defined areas where only the target language is used
- **Difficulty Boundaries**: Geographic regions with progressively challenging language content
- **Time-Limited Challenges**: Location-specific tasks that must be completed within a certain timeframe

### 4. Dynamic Weather and Time Integration

- **Real-time Weather API**: Vocabulary related to current weather conditions at the virtual location
- **Day/Night Cycle**: Time-appropriate phrases and activities based on local time in the target country
- **Seasonal Content**: Language related to seasonal events and traditions when applicable

## Implementation Example: Tokyo Station Scenario

When a player navigates to Tokyo Station in the game:

1. **ArcGIS identifies**: Major transportation hub, shopping area, business district
2. **System activates**: Train vocabulary, shopping phrases, formal business Japanese
3. **LLM receives context**: "User is at Tokyo Station, intermediate level, rush hour time"
4. **Map displays**: Interactive train departures board, directional signage in Japanese, crowded platform visuals
5. **Challenge triggers**: "Navigate to Yamanote Line platform using only Japanese directions"

The ArcGIS mapping doesn't just show where the player is—it actively shapes what they learn, how they learn it, and creates an authentic context that makes language acquisition more natural and memorable.

## Key Logic Paths Explained

This flowchart illustrates the complete logic flow of the Language Voyager game. Here are the main components:

### Initial Setup & Geographic Context

1. **User Configuration**: Player selects target language and proficiency level
2. **Map Initialization**: ArcGIS map loads with appropriate starting location
3. **Geographic Analysis**: When a player moves to a position, the system:
    - Extracts physical features (mountains, water bodies, etc.)
    - Identifies nearby points of interest
    - Determines the administrative region (affecting dialect)
    - Calculates urban density (affecting language formality)

### Content Generation

1. **Context Building**: All geographic data forms a location context
2. **Content Selection**: The system queries relevant:
    - Vocabulary sets
    - Dialect variations
    - Appropriate formality levels
    - Cultural information
3. **Difficulty Adaptation**: Content is adjusted based on user's proficiency
4. **LLM Prompting**: Context-rich prompts are generated for the language model

### User Interaction Loop

1. **Interaction Types**:
    - Conversational practice with virtual locals
    - Specific language challenges/tasks
    - Cultural lessons with knowledge assessment
2. **User Response Handling**: Evaluates user's language attempts
3. **Progress Tracking**: Updates mastery metrics across vocabulary, grammar, and cultural knowledge

### Map Progression System

1. **Unlock Mechanics**: Checks if user has met criteria to unlock new areas
2. **Proximity Triggers**: Detects when user approaches special locations
3. **Action Cycle**: Continuous loop of movement, interaction, and progression

### Technical Integration Points

- ArcGIS spatial queries drive content selection
- Vector database retrieves appropriate language materials
- LLM generates contextually appropriate conversations
- Player progress is continuously synchronized with map access

This comprehensive logic flow ensures that the geographic context directly shapes the language learning experience, making map interaction an integral part of the educational process rather than just a visual element.

    - Content moderation in community features.

---

### **Recommendations**

1. **MVP Approach**
    
    Start with a single region (e.g., Tokyo) and basic interactions (directions, food ordering). Validate core tech (GIS + LLM) before scaling.
    
2. **Hybrid Content Strategy**
    - Use AI to generate draft content, but rely on human experts for validation.
    - Partner with cultural organizations for authentic regional data.
3. **Progressive Feature Rollout**
    
    Prioritize:
    
    - Core map interactions + vocabulary
    - LLM conversations
    - Multiplayer features (post-launch).
4. **Performance Mitigations**
    - Use CDNs for static map assets.
    - Edge computing for AI responses.
    - Offline mode for basic challenges.
5. **Monetization Models**
    - Freemium: Free base regions, paid expansions (e.g., "Unlock Kansai Dialect Pack").
    - Institutional licensing (schools, corporate training).

### **Conclusion**

**Feasibility Rating: Moderate-High**

The project is technically achievable with existing tools but requires significant investment in content curation, performance tuning, and iterative UX testing. Success hinges on balancing educational rigor with engaging gameplay and securing partnerships for cultural/localization support. A phased rollout focusing on a single language/region would mitigate initial risks.

# Implementation Plan

## 1. Project Setup:
Create [ASP.NET](http://asp.net/) Core Web API project
Set up directory structure
Configure SQLite
Add required NuGet packages

### Files Created/Modified:
1. backend-csharp/.gitignore - ✓ Created with proper C# ignores
2. backend-csharp/Backend.csproj - ✓ Created with required NuGet packages
3. backend-csharp/Program.cs - ✓ Created with basic ASP.NET Core setup
4. backend-csharp/appsettings.json - ✓ Created with SQLite configuration
5. Directory structure - ✓ Created via create-structure.sh
Everything appears to be in place according to the technical specifications. The structure matches the requirements, and all necessary files have been created with appropriate configurations

## 2. Data Layer:
Create entity models
Set up DbContext
Configure Entity Framework
Create migrations
Create seed data

### Files Created/Modified:
1. Models/*.cs - ✓ Created all entity models (Word, Group, WordGroup, etc.)
2. Data/AppDbContext.cs - ✓ Created with entity configurations and relationships
3. Data/Migrations/20240301000000_InitialCreate.cs - ✓ Created with all table definitions
4. Data/SeedData/*.json - ✓ Created seed data files
5. Services/DataSeeder.cs - ✓ Created seeding service
6. Services/DatabaseManager.cs - ✓ Created database management service
7. Program.cs - ✓ Updated with EF Core and service registrations

Everything appears to be in place according to the technical specifications. All database tables are properly defined with relationships, seed data is structured correctly, and database management tasks are implemented.

⚠️ Items for Review:
- Verify study_activities.json schema matches API specs
- Add more comprehensive seed data
- Verify snake_case naming in migrations

## 3. Service Layer:
Implement repository pattern
Create services for each domain
Implement business logic

## 4. API Layer:
Create controllers
Implement endpoints
Set up JSON response formatting
Add pagination support

## 5. Database Management:
Create migration scripts
Create seeding mechanism
Implement reset functionality

## 6. Testing:
Unit tests for services
Integration tests for API
Database tests

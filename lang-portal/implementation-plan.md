# Implementation Plan

## 1. Project Setup:
Create [ASP.NET](http://asp.net/) Core Web API project
Set up directory structure
Configure SQLite
Add required NuGet packages

### Files Created/Modified:

3. backend-csharp/Program.cs - ✓ Created with basic ASP.NET Core setup
4. backend-csharp/appsettings.json - ✓ Created with SQLite configuration
5. Directory structure - ✓ Created via create-structure.sh
Everything appears to be in place according to the technical specifications. The structure matches the requirements, and all necessary files have been created with appropriate configurations

## 2. Data Layer:
✓ Create entity models
   - Word.cs
   - Group.cs
   - WordGroup.cs (join table)
   - StudySession.cs
   - StudyActivity.cs

✓ Set up DbContext
   - AppDbContext.cs with entity configurations
   - Snake case naming convention
   - Entity relationships

✓ Configure Entity Framework
   - SQLite configuration
   - Connection string setup

### Files Created/Modified:
1. Models/*.cs - ✓ Created all entity models (Word, Group, WordGroup, etc.)
2. Data/AppDbContext.cs - ✓ Created with entity configurations and relationships
3. Data/Migrations/20240301000000_InitialCreate.cs - ✓ Created with all table definitions
4. Data/SeedData/*.json - ✓ Created seed data files
5. Services/DataSeeder.cs - ✓ Created seeding service
6. Services/DatabaseManager.cs - ✓ Created database management service
7. Program.cs - ✓ Updated with EF Core and service registrations

Everything appears to be in place according to the technical specifications. All database tables are properly defined with relationships, seed data is structured correctly, and database management tasks are implemented.

## 3. Service Layer:
✓ Implement repository pattern
   - Generic IRepository<T> and Repository<T>
   - Word Repository
   - Group Repository
   - StudySession Repository
   - StudyActivity Repository

   - WordService
   - GroupService
   - StudySessionService
   - StudyActivityService

✓ Implement business logic
   - Word management
   - Group management
   - Study session tracking
   - Activity management
   - Progress calculation
   - Statistics generation

### Files Created/Modified:
1. Services/Repositories/*.cs - ✓ Created all repository interfaces and implementations
2. Services/*.cs - ✓ Created service interfaces and implementations
3. Program.cs - ✓ Updated with repository and service registrations

Everything appears to be in place according to the technical specifications. All repositories and services are implemented with proper business logic, error handling, and logging.

## 4. API Layer:
✓ Create controllers
   - DashboardController
   - WordsController
   - GroupsController
   - StudyActivitiesController
   - StudySessionsController
   - SystemController

✓ Implement endpoints

   - Words endpoints
   - Groups endpoints
   - Study Sessions endpoints
   - System Reset endpoints

✓ Set up JSON response formatting
   - Snake case naming convention
   - Consistent response structure
   - Proper error responses

✓ Add pagination support
   - Page and page size parameters
   - Total items and pages
   - Consistent pagination structure

### Files Created/Modified:
1. Controllers/DashboardController.cs - ✓ Created with dashboard endpoints
2. Controllers/WordsController.cs - ✓ Created with CRUD operations
3. Controllers/GroupsController.cs - ✓ Created with group management
4. Controllers/StudyActivitiesController.cs - ✓ Created with activity endpoints
5. Controllers/StudySessionsController.cs - ✓ Created with session management
6. Controllers/SystemController.cs - ✓ Created with reset functionality

Everything appears to be in place according to the technical specifications. All required endpoints are implemented with proper error handling, JSON formatting, and pagination where needed.
